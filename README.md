This is not mine in anyway, I only adjusted the script to meet my needs.

Must add emergency.doc permissions to your on duty EMS job.
Must add coma.skipper permissions to you citizen. -- can remove if you don't want to allow people to instant ALS when no EMS are on duty.
Must add coma.caller permissions to citizen.

When someone dies it will prompt them to press E if EMS is available and will call EMS. If EMS is not available pressing E will instantly ALS person.
Press W to start car when you sit in it.
Press K to toggle engine off and on.

I still need to clean up some of the server file to not include things not being used.
